# 💊 Conversational Pharmaceutical Assistant using LLMs and RAG

This project is a conversational assistant developed as part of a Master's thesis in **Big Data Analytics** at **USTHB**. The assistant automates customer service tasks for pharmaceutical use cases using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

## 🧠 Overview

The assistant is designed to handle real-world pharmacy-related queries such as:
- Product search
- Order tracking
- Proposing medication alternatives
- Registering and classifying customer claims

It integrates an LLM with a retrieval system that fetches relevant context from structured data (CSV) to provide accurate, real-time answers.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **LangChain**
- **OpenAI API / GPT-4**
- **HuggingFace Embeddings**
- **ChromaDB** (Vector Store)
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **JSON / CSV**
- **FastAPI** (optional, for deployment)
- **Git / GitHub**

## 🧩 Architecture

- 🧠 LLM Agent (LangChain + OpenAI)
- 📁 Contextual Retrieval (RAG using HuggingFace + ChromaDB)
- 📊 Pharmacy Dataset (CSV-based)
- ⚙️ Custom tools and prompts for domain-specific tasks
